Hi! I'm working on some developer tools.

See these projects:

- [Ristretto](https://codeberg.org/macchiato/ristretto) - A project to create a code and data playground and notebook
- [Macchiato Pages App](https://codeberg.org/macchiato/pages) - An Android-friendly mobile app that has every page in its own sandboxed iframe and stores its content in LocalStorage
- [vtv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vtv) ([demo](https://vega-playground.resources.co/)) ([code](https://github.com/ResourcesCo/resources/tree/main/packages/vtv)) ([blog posts](https://resources.co/blog))

Work is underway to build an overall Macchiato project that brings these together, and to build a platform that uses it on [resources.co](https://resources.co/).
